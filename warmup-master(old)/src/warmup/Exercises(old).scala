    /* Assignment 3:

      An infamous unsolved problem in discrete math is the
      "Collatz conjecture" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).


      For any positive integer n, the corresponding "Collatz sequence" starts with the number n.
      The next number in the sequence is defined as follows:
          if n is even, the next number is n/2
          if n is odd,  the next number is 3n + 1
      The subsequencent numbers are constructed in the same way.
      For example, if we start with 11, the corresponding Collatz sequence is:
      11,34,17,52,26,13,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1,4,2,1,4,...
      Once a Collatz sequence has reached 1, the sequence will repeat the pattern 4,2,1 forever.

      The Collatz conjecture states that, no matter which integer we start with, the collatz sequence will
      eventually reach 1 and repeat the pattern 4,2,1 forever. The conjecture is probably true, and has been checked
      by computers for all starting values up to 87Ã—2^60(!). However, there is no mathematical proof for seemingly
      simple statement. There have been  mathematicians that have spent years of continued study on the conjecture,
      without success.Mathematical professor Jeffrey Lagarias has written a book about Collatz conjecture, and stated
      that "this is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics".

      Luckily, programming the Collatz sequence is much easier! Please implement a function which when given a starting
       number, returns the number of elements in the sequence before reaching 1. For example:
       collatzLength(11) = 14
       collatzLength(1) = 0
       collatzLength(4) = 2
       collatzLength(7) = 16
       collatzLength(27) = 111

  /* Assignment 6: Elo ratings

  In chess and various other forms of competition the skill of a player is indicated using
  the Elo-rating system. The elo-rating is a number in the 0-3000 range, where 0 is an absolute beginner and
  2900 is the world champion.

  When given the ratings of two players rA and rB, the probability of a winning the game is calculated as follows:

  eA = 1 / ( 1 + 10^((rB - ra) / 400)))

  This gives a number between 0 (100 % sure that a loses) and 1 (100 % sure that a wins).

  After playing a game or tournament, the elo ratings of the player are updated based on their wins and loses. The
  new rating of a player is calculated based on the probability of a winning eA and the actual outcome aA.

  rA' = rA + k * (aA - eA)

  where k is a constant controlling the importance of the game (typically between 16-32). We use k=24.

  For example, if player a has an elo rating of 2000 and player b has a elo rating of 2200, then the probability of
  player a winning is 1 / ( 1 + 10^((2200 - 2000) / 400))) = 0.24. Suppose player a wins the game, so aA=1.0.
  Then the new elo score of player a is 2000 + 24 * (1.0 - 0.24) = 2018.24. For player b the computation is reversed,
  his probability of winning was (1 - 0.24) = 0.76. The new elo score of player b is
  2200 + 24 * (0.0 - 0.76) = 2181.76

  NOTICE: During a tournament, the rating of players is not changed until the tournament finishes, after which all
  games are processed and everyone's new elo score is determined. The elo scores of the players do not change during
   the tournament, only after. 

  Program a method which updates the elo ratings of all players. You can (and should) add method to classes below.


  We test this as follows:

    val jaap = new Player("Jaap",2000)
    val piet = new Player("Piet", 2200)
    val game = new Game(jaap,piet,0.0)
    Exercises.updateEloScores(List(jaap,piet), List(game) )
    assert(jaap.rating === 2018.24 +- 0.01)
    assert(piet.rating === 2181.76 +- 0.01)

  /* Assignment 7: List speed offenders.

  Two sets of cameras have been set up on the A2 highway near Utrecht to find speed offenders. The sets of cameras,
  named "A" and "B", are 1500 meters apart and the speed limit is 100 km/h between 6:00 and 19:00 and 120 km/h between
  19:00 and 6:00. If a car passed both cameras in a (single) 6:00 to 19:00 period then it is going too fast if its speed
  is over 100 km/h. If a car passed either camera in between 19:00 and 6:00, then it is going too fast if its speed is over
  120 km/h.

  The cameras are only positioned on the North-bound direction of the highway, and the cars first pass the "A" cameras
  and then the "B" cameras. After processing, the cameras produce a list of cars and the times they passed as
  follows (definitions of Observation and Time below):

  Observation(cameraSet = "A", licensePlate = "DX-98-DW", time = Time(18492, 13, 3, 5.0))
  Observation(cameraSet = "B", licensePlate = "WW-11-XX", time = Time(18492, 13, 3, 6.0))

  ....
  Observation(cameraSet = "A", licensePlate = "DX-98-DW", time = Time(18492, 13, 4, 1.0))

  in the order that the cars passed cameraset B.

  /* Assignment 10 : Mergesort

  Implement mergesort. Mergesort is a recursive sorting algorithm that works by splitting arrays and merging them.
  More precisely, mergeSort works as follows:

   If the input array is of length <= 1, then the array is already sorted an the input array is returned.
   If the input array is of length >= 2, then the input array is split in two (using the splitArray function),
   the two smaller arrays are sorted using mergesort, and the resulting two sorted arrays are merged using
   mergeSortedArrays.

   Example:
        7 5 6 1    -- split
       /      \     -- merge sort left and right recursively
     7 5     6 1     -- split both sides
     /  \    /  \
    7   5   6   1     -- merge both sides
    \   /   \  /    -- left and right merge sort done
